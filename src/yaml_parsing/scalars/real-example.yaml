  Expand the key-value pairs into the import CTEs.


  The CTE names will be the key, and the values will be the relation used in
  the `FROM` clause. There is a special named parameter `import_options`
  which can be used to pass options to the macro.


  Example usage:

      -- Simple usage
      {% raw %}{{ tasman_dbt_utils.import(
          orders=source("orders"),
          customers=ref("customers")
      ) }}{% endraw %}

      -- Using the import options
      {% raw %}{{ tasman_dbt_utils.import(
          orders=source("orders"),
          import_options={
              "expand_columns": true,
              "recursive": true
          }
      ) }}{% endraw %}
  ```

  This model contains each subscription by day. Both trial and paid subscriptions are included.
  Based on the subscription_change_label a quick history of the subscription is given. Only paid
  subscriptions are included in this column. We look across subscriptions regardless of the subscription_id.
  It compares the subscription with the previous month. If the subscription_id remains the same
  it uses that to see if the subscription has changed. If the subscription_id changes we connect it
  to the new subscription_id.

      I.e.:
      - Subscription A is active on January 1st
      - Subscription A is stopped on January 2nd
      - Subscription B is active on January 2nd
      - Subscription B is connected to Subscription A
